# Fraud & Anomaly Detection (AML)

## 1. Business Context
Financial institutions must detect suspicious behaviors to comply with AML regulations (AML/FT).

## 2. Objective
Build a machine learning system to identify anomalous transactions and risky profiles.

## 3. Architecture
Data ingestion → Feature engineering → Anomaly detection models → Risk scoring → Monitoring dashboard

## 4. Tech Stack
- Python
- PySpark
- Scikit-learn
- pyspark.ml
- PostgreSQL
- HDFS
- OCR
- BigDATA
- MongoDB
- Power BI

## 5. Results
- Multi-criteria anomaly scoring
- Explainable risk indicators
- Scalable pipeline for large volumes

## 6. Improvements
- Real-time detection
- Model drift monitoring
- Advanced explainability
